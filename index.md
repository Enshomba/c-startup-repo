well this is the c++ journey starting 


first i can write about myself
the inspiration to starting up learning c++ is that i want to help the world through my software
make money
and retire coding c++

and of all i love the discipline though my friends think i should rather do python or java 
I found out that c++ will even make me more busy in understanding how the computer works!!



there we Go its c++ time 
a daily notation
